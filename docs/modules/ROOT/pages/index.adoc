= GIF Contracts

*Secure and audited smart contracts to develop decentralized insurance applications.* 

 * GIF Contracts is a library of smart contracts for decentralized insurance applications.



== Overview

[[install]]
=== Installation

```console
$ npm install @etherisc/gif-contracts
```

Etherisc GIF Contracts features a xref:releases-stability.adoc#api-stability[stable API], which means your contracts won't break unexpectedly when upgrading to a newer minor version.

[[usage]]
=== Usage

Once installed, you can use the contracts in the library by importing them:

[source,solidity]
----
// contracts/MyProduct.sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.2;

import "@etherisc/gif-interface/contracts/components/Product.sol";

contract MyProduct is Product {

    bytes32 public constant POLICY_FLOW = "PolicyDefaultFlow";

    constructor(
        bytes32 productName,
        address token,
        address registry,
        uint256 riskpoolId,
    )
        Product(productName, token, POLICY_FLOW, riskpoolId, registry)
    {
    }
}
----

TIP: If you're new to smart contract development, head to ... 
// TODO: Add resource here 
to learn about creating a new project and compiling your contracts.

To keep your system secure, you should **always** use the installed code as-is, and neither copy-paste it from online sources, nor modify it yourself. The library is designed so that only the contracts and functions you use are deployed, so you don't need to worry about it needlessly increasing gas costs.

== Error Codes

Each error has a 7-letter identifier of the form `XXX-\###`. The first three letters indicate the component where the error occurred, and the last three letters indicate the error number within that component.
A list of the error codes with explanations / conditions is available in the xref:errors.adoc[Errors] section.

== Learn More

The guides in the sidebar will teach about different concepts, and how to use the related contracts that GIF Contracts provides:

////
* xref:access-control.adoc[Access Control]: decide who can perform each of the actions on your system.
* xref:tokens.adoc[Tokens]: create tradable assets or collectibles, like the well known xref:erc20.adoc[ERC20] and xref:erc721.adoc[ERC721] standards.
* xref:gsn.adoc[Gas Station Network]: let your users interact with your contracts without having to pay for gas themselves.
* xref:utilities.adoc[Utilities]: generic useful tools, including non-overflowing math, signature verification, and trustless paying systems.

The xref:api:token/ERC20.adoc[full API] is also thoroughly documented, and serves as a great reference when developing your smart contract application. You can also ask for help or follow Contracts' development in the https://forum.openzeppelin.com[community forum].

Finally, you may want to take a look at the https://blog.openzeppelin.com/guides/[guides on our blog], which cover several common use cases and good practices.. The following articles provide great background reading, though please note, some of the referenced tools have changed as the tooling in the ecosystem continues to rapidly evolve.
